- 👋 Hi, I’m @salomesodini - a midwife turned an apprentice software engineer.

- 👀 I’m interested in intersetional feminism, coffee breaks & (trying to) make things better. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, SQL & HTML + CSS.
- 💞️ When I'm not coding, you can find me doing yoga, attempting to run or writing cheesy posts. 
- 📫 How to reach me: salo.sodini@gmail.com. I am also on Twitter/X (senzasquadre)
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her (English), lei/di lei (Italian), ela/dela (Portuguese)
